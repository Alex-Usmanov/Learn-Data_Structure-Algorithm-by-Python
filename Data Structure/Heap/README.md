# Heap

A **Heap** is a tree based data structure and it is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property. The ordering can be one of two types:

the **min-heap property:** the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root.

the **max-heap property:** the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root.

**Basic Operations:**

Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

* **Insertion** − Adds an element at the max heap.

* **Deletion** − Deletes an element at the beginning of the heap.

* **Display** − Displays the complete heap.

* **Max** − Get the max element from the heap.


#### Complexity Analysis
- Space - O(n)
- Search - O(n)
- Insertion - O(1)
- Delete - O(log n) (Deletion from beginning)
- Peek - O(1)
