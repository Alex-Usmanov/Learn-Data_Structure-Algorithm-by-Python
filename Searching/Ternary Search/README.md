# Ternary Search

 **Ternary search** algorithm is a technique in computer science for finding the minimum or maximum of a [unimodal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodality) function. A ternary search determines either that the minimum or maximum cannot be in the first third of the domain or that it cannot be in the last third of the domain, then repeats on the remaining two-thirds.
 Unimodal functions are functions that, have a single highest value.


#### Binary Search vs. Ternary Search
Binary search looks a zero or a specific value in case of monotonic(Non-increasing or non-decreasing) input; ternary search is used to locate an extremum for unimodal(Having a single extremum) inputs.


#### Complexity Analysis
- Average Case - O(logn)
